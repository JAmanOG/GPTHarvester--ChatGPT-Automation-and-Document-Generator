It ensures that the content of the message has not been altered and that it comes from a verified source. Digital signatures work through a combination of public key cryptography and hash functions. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Key Pair Generation:\nA digital signature is created using a pair of keys: a private key (which is kept secret by the signer) and a public key (which is shared with others).\nThe private key is used to sign the document, while the public key is used by others to verify the signature.\n2. Signing the Document:\nThe document is passed through a hashing algorithm, which produces a unique hash or message digest.\nThe private key is then used to encrypt the hash. The result is the digital signature.\nThe digital signature is then attached to the document or mes"
